# Getting started

After setting up VSC for C++ development, we just need to create a new project! This is done in a few steps:


## Creating a folder for the project

To set the folder for the project, go to File > Open folder (or press [Ctrl+K Ctrl+O]), a dialog like this will pop up:

Create a new folder and press "Select folder", the dialog will close and the window will reload and open the folder we have created.

## Creating a C++ project

Press F1, a little window will appear with lots of different commands, search for "c++" and click "Create new C++ project":

Now we will be asked what compiler we want to use, look the Easy C++ extension page for information on how to setup a compiler for your operating system. I will use Windows Subsystem for Linux.

## Code!

Now that we finished the creation step, VSC will generate the project structure for us, and open `main.cpp` with some example code:

To test that the project works press the `Build & Run` button on the status bar, a terminal will open and it will compile and execute our program for the first time!
